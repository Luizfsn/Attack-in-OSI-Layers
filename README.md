# Types of Attack in OSI Layer


The OSI is a theoretical framework that defines seven layers of protocols used for communication between computers in a network. Each layer is responsible for a specific aspect of the communication process, such as addressing, routing, or data transfer.

The OSI model helps to standardize communication between different computer systems and to ensure interoperability between different networks.
